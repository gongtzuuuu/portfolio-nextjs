## Portfolio (2024)

![website screenshot](/public/preview.jpg)

Built from the ground up, the portfolio website utilises a modern tech stack including Next.js, React, TypeScript, Storybook, and Shadcn.

Additionally, it employs the i18n library to handle multi-language versions and integrates Framer Motion to create smooth animations, enhancing the user experience.

This website serves as a dynamic platform that not only showcases my skills and experience in text and visual design but also brings them to life through the underlying technology. It is a testament to my drive to push boundaries, evolve as a developer, and explore new technologies.
